## Introduction to ArcTree

This HTML + Javascript page will recurse through the file and build an unordered
HTML tree with nice arcs and collapsible nodes.

## ArcTree Options

There are also some options at the top (if shown the the user) that allows
collapsing or expanding the whole tree:
![Options Dialog for ArcTree](imgs/ArcTreeOptions.png)

- **Collapse Leafs** will temporarily hide list nodes which have a blank
  children node, i.e., `children:[]`. The `children` node is required even if
  empty.
- **Show Leafs** just re-expands all nodes if any were hidden.
- **Collapse Tree** will collapse _all_ nodes in the entire tree, allowing users
  to gradually expand only the nodes they wish.
- **Expand Tree** expands (opens) all nodes in the tree, allowing users to
  selectively collapse any nodes they don't wish taking up visible space
- **Font Size** changes the font size (in em units) between 0.5 em on up to 5.0
  em in 0.5 increments.
- **Browse** button allows selecting a JSON file formatted as shown above. Upon
  being selected, any existing tree is cleared and rebuilt.

## Formatting

Although not trivial, folks that know basic CSS can alter the symbols and colors
used to display open and closed nodes. I have tried to provide more
documentation as to what CSS affects various parts of the ArcTree!

## JSON Data File Format

JSON files are expected to be formatted as:

```JSON
{
    "title": "web page title",
    "url": "https://www.sample.com",
    "meta": "web page description",
    "children": [
        {
            "title": "child page title",
            "url": "/1st-child",
            "meta": "child page description",
            "children": [{...}, {...}]
        },
        {
            "title": "another child page title",
            "url": "/2nd-child",
            "meta": "another child page description",
            "children": []
        }
    ]
}
```

- URLs can be relative/incremental to their parent or fully-specified/complete
  URLs. If a url begins with "http", it is assumed to be a full url, otherwise
  the parent url will be prepended.
- It should soon be possible to 'jump' up to a none-sequential URLs. For
  instance from https://www.sample.com/ to https://www.sample.com/child1/child2
  -- _without going thru https://www.sample.com/child1 first_. We handle this by
  inserting a dummy list item with the missing intermediate child/parent page,
  though the website may not have such a page, resulting in potential 404 errors
  for the 'created' page.
- Try https://duckduckgo.com/?q=json+validator as a nice way to spot formatting
  errors.
- When opened, JSON files are validated just by seeing they have success with
  JSON.parse currently.
- In the future we may enable AJX validation which is more sophisticated. Read
  more about it at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv.
- The `children` node is essential, but can be an empty array (i.e., a leaf):
  `"children"=[]`

## Programming Notes

- Additional attributes (akin to "title", "meta", or "url") can be included for
  each node, but will be denoted with "[Unknown node (" in the tree display.
  Adding new cases to the `switch` statement in `function buildArcTree` in the
  `arcTree.js` file should be pretty trivial though. See the code comment.
- Adding additional arrays will require some coding, but the current code should
  provide some hints to make it 'fairly' painless.
- Only the initial call to `buildArcTree()` should ignore the optional URL
  value.

## Debugging

- By default, the `arcTree.js` file has `let verbose = 0;` at the top. Change
  this to `1` or '2' if you wish to track output and see errors, warnings &
  verbose information. These can be viewed by opening any browser's developers
  tools (`F12` by convention) and then open it's 'console window'.

Thanks to https://codepen.io/bisserof/pen/nrMveb for the nice css formatting of
the arcs! Their original sample provided the inspiration for this project.
